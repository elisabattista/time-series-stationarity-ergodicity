# Time Series: Stationarity and Ergodicity

This repository contains my university project for the course **Time Series Analysis**, focused on the concepts of **stationarity** and **ergodicity** in stochastic processes.

## 📚 Project Overview

The project includes:

- A theoretical derivation of the conditions for **weak stationarity** and **non-ergodicity** in an AR(1) process with a random mean.
- Simulation studies in **R** to illustrate the behavior of the process.
- Empirical comparisons between theoretical and simulated results (mean, variance, ACF, PACF).
- A second exercise involving the simulation and study of an **MA(2)** process based on coin toss experiments.

## 🛠️ Files included

- `Battista.Rmd` → R Markdown source file with code, formulas, and explanations.
- `Battista.pdf` → PDF version of the report.
- Images and plots generated during the analysis.

## 🖥️ Tools used

- R
- R Markdown
- LaTeX (via TinyTeX)
- GitHub

## 📅 Context

This project was part of my coursework for the **Time Series Analysis** class during my Master's degree in **Quantitative Finance**.
